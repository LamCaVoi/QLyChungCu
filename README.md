# Apartment Management App
This app is written as my final's java project. I was quite ambitious with this and really want to do something that would push my skill set to its limit. After quite a bit of research and jumping around, i settled with a plan: Try to use spring-boot framework to build my app. It was a horrible decision looking back at it, as this was way out of my leauge (it still does to this day). A month full of bugs fixing, researching and more bugs fixing went by and this was the final product. A really basic and simple app with very limited amount of functions. I didn't have enough time to put in all the stuff i planed to and I take all responsibilities. Alot of time was burnt-off becasuse I was clueless with what I was doing and just got lost in the wrong directions. In the end, I'm grateful for the experience. Looking back at the original goal I'd say that I did build something with Spring-Boot. That's a good-enough win for me
